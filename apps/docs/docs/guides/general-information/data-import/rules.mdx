# Import Rules

Defining import rules.

## Transaction rule system

The rule system classifies the import data, explaining how to convert segmented data into *transfers*. Initially, the process starts by duplicating the settings and rules set for the importer. Throughout the process, it is possible to ask questions and add more details.

The configuration comprises the following structure:
```json
{
  "language": "fi",
  "currency": "EUR",
   ...
  "account.income.currency.EUR": "1910",
   ...
  "rules": [...],
  "questions": {...},
  "answers": {...}
}
```
There are
1. Universal settings, such as *language* and *currency*.
2. During the import process, there might be a configuration for account and import settings that could have been resolved by asking the user. Users can copy these settings for future imports.
3. The **rules** section explains segment-to-transfer mapping.
4. The **questions** section covers UI questions that cannot be automated and require user interaction.
5. The **answers** section stores segmented responses. The importer does not copy data universally, only as relevant to the current import.

### Settings

The following general settings are used:
- `currency` - A main currency of the bookkeeping database.
- `language` - A translation language for the imported texts.
- `tags.*.*.*` - A list of tags to be added for every transaction descriptions. Also some specific tags
                 can be specified, since `*.*.*` uses the same convention than account configurations.

Accounts are defined as follows:
- `account.<reason>.<type>.<asset>` - An account number to be used for the given purpose.
                                      Parts can be `'*'` to allow any purpose. Otherwise they are
                                      explained in more detail in (TODO: Link to doc TransferAnalyzer).

Miscellaneous optional settings:
- `isTradeFeePartOfTotal` If set to true, assume the trading fee is included in the total. Otherwise, it is an additional cost.
- `recordDeposits` If set to false, skip deposits.
- `recordWithdrawals` If set to false, skip withdrawls.
- `allowShortSelling` If set, allow short selling. This means selling assets not currently owned.

#### Example
```json
{
  "currency": "EUR",
  "language": "en",
  "tags.*.*.*": ["Lynx"],
  "account.deposit.currency.EUR": "1918",
  "account.deposit.external.EUR": "9999",
  "account.withdrawal.currency.EUR": "1918",
  "account.withdrawal.external.EUR": "9999",
  "account.expense.statement.INTEREST_EXPENSE": "9550",
  "account.expense.currency.EUR": "1918",

  "rules": [],
  "questions": [],
  "answers": {}
}
```

### Rules

A list of rule definitions makes up the rules section:
```json
{
   "name": "Name of the rule",
   "filter": "<expression>",
   "comment": "<optional description>",
   "options": {
     <optional flags>
   },
   "result": [
      <transfer1>, <transfer2>...
   ]
}
```

The *name* is any string describing the rule.
Rules are used so that each segment resulting from the segmentation step are handled in the order of their timestamps.
Lines belonging to the segment are offered one by one to the filter expression and, if returning true, the entries in *result* are concatenated together. Each entry in the result is a *transfer description*.


During processing, variables are set for filtering and result expressions. All variables from the segmentation are included. Typically, these names are identical to the column names mentioned in the CSV file.
See (TODO: Link to doc TransactionRules.classifyLines) for other variables available.

The structure of transfers are explained in (TODO: Link to doc TransferAnalyzer).

The syntax of the filter and result are explained in (TODO: link to doc TransactionUI.parseQuery).

Currently, one boolean option is supported. With `singleMatch`, the parsing result is returned as soon as any line in the segment matches the rule. The rest of the lines are ignored. For example, it is useful when using `sum(lines, ‘field’)` to gather values from all lines of the segment at once.

### Questions

There are situations where an importer cannot deduct some part of the transfer automatically. In that case, we can define a question that needs to be answered every time when the matching rule has been found. For example, we may determine, based on the transaction data, that it is related to computers, but we want to know the exact type of the purchase. Then we can define a question:
```json
  {
    "name": "Computer purchase",
    "label": "What category is the purchase",
    "ask": {
      "Hardware equipment": "HARDWARE",
      "Software": "SOFTWARE"
    }
  },
```

The question can be used in the transfer as explained in (TODO: link to doc TransferAnalyzer).

Different question types are documented in (TODO: link to doc TransactionUI.parseQuery).

### Answers

This section collects answers given earlier during the processing. Answers are grouped per segment ID per transfer. For example:
```json
"d3e89d9af37dda4609bed94770fc5c52be946175": {
  "type": "HARDWARE"
},
```
The segment ID may contain also complete transaction definition, which will override all parsing
```json
  "581e46d024678ddcddc01ae36369bf6fc54f16b2": {
    "transfers": [
      {
        "data": {
          "text": "Payment for something"
        },
        "type": "account",
        "asset": "8650",
        "amount": 59.27,
        "reason": "expense"
      },
      {
        "type": "account",
        "asset": "3020",
        "amount": -59.27,
        "reason": "expense"
      }
    ]
 }
```
There is also a global answer section applied to all imports. If an asset has changed its name, it can be
stored like this in the empty segment ID:
```json
  {
  "": {
    "asset-renaming": [
        {
          "date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
          "type": "stock",
          "old": "<OLD ASSET>"
          "new": "<NEW ASSET>"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```
