# Rule Engine

A scripting language available for defining rules.

## Core
The core of the rules engine is based on the [MathJS](https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/syntax.html).
All features of MathJS are available.

### Variables
Typically a collection of variables are defined for the processing. For example in importing CSV file
we have all columns defined as variables. Note that the parser accept wide range of characters to be
used in the variable name. Those which cannot be expressed directly, we can use syntax like
  `$('Variable with space')`

### Relations
In addition to the standard relations, the engine defines comparisons and concatenation for strings.

### Custom Functions
These functions are specifically defined for the rules engine:
