# Local Component Development

Running Tasenor Bookkeeper using individual components.

## Pre-requisities

The setup is the same as in Turbo version.

* Node environment (prefereably with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
* [turbo](https://turbo.build/repo)
* [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

## Installing Development Copy

Get a copy of the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dataplugoy/tasenor-bookkeeper.git
```
Then install needed NPM-packages
```sh
cd tasenor-bookkeeper/
pnpm install
```

## Launching Individual Pieces

If starting from the root of the repository, launching each component of the system separately is possible.

1. Database
  ```sh
  cd databases/bookkeeper/
  pnpm run dev
  ```
2. Backend
  ```sh
  cd apps/bookkeeper-api/
  pnpm run dev
  ```
3. Plugin server for UI
  ```sh
  cd apps/bookkeeper/
  pnpm run dev-ui-plugin-server
  ```
4. UI itself
  ```sh
  cd apps/bookkeeper/
  pnpm run dev-vite
  ```
  It is also possible to run #3 (Plugin server for UI) and #4 (UI) together using `pnpm run dev`.

Now, create an admin user and start exploring the system at [http://localhost:7204/](http://localhost:7204/).
