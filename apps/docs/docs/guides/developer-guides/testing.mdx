# Testing

Testing guidelines and possibilities.

## Introduction to Testing
The Tasenor Project is subject to multiple layers of testing. Because testing data sometimes is from real companies and actual use cases, it is not possible to carry out certain tests in a public environment. This data is stored in a dedicated and private repository, and it undergoes testing during nightly test runs.

A developer needs to sign an NDA agreement to get access to the private repository. An individual or organisation can also donate testing material from their private data, if they want to ensure processes critical to them remain intact and unaltered in future code changes. The NDA also protects this data.

## Test Types

### Running CI Test

The script `ci` in each `packages.json` contains a collection of tests that serve as the gatekeeper for publishing individual NPM-packages. To verify that local changes will be successful, a local system up is needed
```sh
turbo dev
```
to run all scripts
```sh
turbo run ci
```
