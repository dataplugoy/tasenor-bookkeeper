# Testing

Testing guidelines and possibilities.

## Introduction to Testing

Tasenor Project has multiple layers of testing. Unfortunately not all of it can be public.
We have some testing data from real companies and real use cases to verify that certain
processes are accurate and produces correct result. That material is stored in separate
private repository and is tested in nightly test run.

You need to sign NDA agreement to get access to that repository. You can also donate testing
material from your own private data if you want to ensure that processes critical to you
remain intact and unaltered in future code changes. Data will be protected with NDA as well.

## Test Types

TODO: Describe different types, tools used and how to run.

### Running CI Test

The gatekeeper for publishing individual NPM-packages is a collection of tests under the
script `ci` in each `packages.json`. To verify that local changes will pass, you need the
local system up
```sh
turbo dev
```
and then run all scripts
```sh
turbo run ci
```
