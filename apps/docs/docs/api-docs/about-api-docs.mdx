# API Documentation

The Bookkeeper API has a comprehensive OpenAPI v3.0 documentation. Unfortunately, the current version of the
[Docusaurus OpenAPI plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs)
is too buggy to be of any use. Also, automatic generation of the documentation is not feasible either. We remain optimistic that the development team will resolve these issues in the near future.
